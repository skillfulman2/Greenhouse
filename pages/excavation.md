# Excavation
----

It seemed like I had 2 options to get this hole dug, rent an excavator or buy a backhoe. I decided on the latter. They both can accomplish similar work but the backhoe requires a little more time and planning.

6.22.22 - There hasn't been an update in a little bit because I've mainly just been digging and coating the EPS perimiter walls. I've got around 15x40x8.5 dug out as of today. Have a time lapse of the dig I might have to upload to youtube instead of here because of size issues.

This was the hole on June 7th I started digging on May 30th.

Definitely am learning how to operate the backhoe without causing massive leaks. Started running the engine at lower RPM's; it's moves slower but haven't had any downtime to retighten fittings.

And with the closing of the holiday weekend I've finished excavation. Very worried about the next steps but I was very worred about excavating. Going to order gravel once I get the sides cleaned up.
