# Excavation
----

It seemed like I had 2 options to get this hole dug, rent an excavator or buy a backhoe. I decided on the latter. They both ultimatley can accomplish similar work but the backhoe requires a little more time and planning. My goal in this endeavor is not to die though so if I feel that I am putting myself at risk by using the backhoe I will rent an excavator for a day.
