It's been a little bit since I've posted an update. At this point I have essentially every thing I need minus the PVC that I am going to get from Lowes, coatings, and geotube which is being shipped from Illinois next week. Today I picked up a 26' UHAUL full of EPS foam from Wayne's Building Supply in Laurelville Ohio.\

Picking up an entire truck full of foam will overwhelm even the most confident of DIY'ers. Fortunatley this is a part of my dream and nothing will get between my and the finish line. The photos might not do it justice but a 26' foot van full of foam is a lot of foam. Here's a nice picture of the van right before the sunset. \

Friends are a necessary and important part of life and unloading the van without them would have been impossible soI am grateful for them. If it wasn't clear before today has made it abundantly clear that this whole thing will not be done alone. \

Steps in the short term include:
	1. Continuing hole excavation
		2. I've started in the east corner and will work my way around with the trackhoe. Hydraulic lines starting leaking and cut my work short it will be an easy fix thanks to the folks on the heavy duty machinery forum (shoutout to Delmer and Tinkerer). Moments like this make me appreciate the power of the internet when used in the right way. \

	2. After excavation I will need a level foundation comprised of 4" of pea gravel. If this proves to be too difficult to do by myself I have no problem calling in the professionals, but the whole point of this journey is to show anyone that they can do it by themselves and some help from loved ones. I've purchased 3 soil temperature/moisture gauges that I will lay at different levels and locations in the thermal battery to be able to measure thermodynamic action in the soil. 
	3. Coating foundation and perimeter EPS to prevent premature degredation. 
	4. PVC grid and plenum head construction. 
	5. Geotube installation
	6. Backfill and tamping. 

I'm really just focusing on the geo battery portion for now because the whole system is really comprised of 2 seperate parts that (ideally) work well together. I'm signing off for now it's late and I'm tired. You'll be hearing from me soon hopefully with good news.\

Onward and upward.
