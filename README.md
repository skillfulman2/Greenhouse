# Greenhouse

Will be using this repository to document the building of my geothermal greenhouse.

Original inspiration for this project was Russ Finch. Taking most of my design choices from the people at Greencube Research. This technology is something that doesn't have a ton of exposure and I have to see if it's "too good to be true".

 Design
------------

### Components

##### Thermal Battery

Used to provide heating/cooling to the greenhouse depending on the time of year. Supposedly much of the earths temperature stays consistenly ~ 12.7°C (55°F for the other dumb americans like me) at around 8'-10'ft deep. Thermal battery will be made by digging a ~~20x40x8.5ft~~ 6.096m x (6.096 * 2m) x 2.5908m hole in the ground. 6 inches of coated EPS insulation on the sides and floor. Cinder blocks for support in the center/walkway. Coated PVC grid, corrugated pipes, adhesive, and gravel make up the rest. 


##### Greenhouse

Insulation on north facing side of greenhouse. Interior structure will be coated PVC and exterior will be polyfilm. Looks less permanent than polycarbonate but from what I can tell it's cheaper in the short term and long term. Fans will pull air into greehouse from the thermal battery.


Notes
-------------------
Will be trying to put my entire process in here. Am going to post costs of everything and where I sourced them from towards the end. My plan is to treat this repository like an extended blog post that is written over the course of the build.
